- [ ] Nodes should arrange in levels/layers
- [ ] Clear hierarchy should be visible

**Algorithm 5: Tree**
- [ ] Click "Tree"
- [ ] Nodes should form tree-like structure
- [ ] Root node should be clearly identifiable

**Algorithm 6: Circular**
- [ ] Click "Circular"
- [ ] Nodes should arrange in circular pattern
- [ ] Circle should be well-formed

**Algorithm 7: Grid**
- [ ] Click "Grid"
- [ ] Nodes should snap to grid positions
- [ ] Regular grid pattern should be visible

**Algorithm 8: Random**
- [ ] Click "Random"
- [ ] Nodes should move to random positions
- [ ] Distribution should look random

#### Step 2.3: Animation Quality Check
- [ ] All transitions are smooth
- [ ] No jerky movements
- [ ] Consistent animation duration
- [ ] No visual glitches

### 🎯 **Phase 3: Multi-Select Testing** (5 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Single Selection
```bash
1. Click on any node
2. Node should be highlighted
3. Info panel should show node details
```

#### Step 3.2: Multi-Select with Ctrl+Click
```bash
1. Hold Ctrl key
2. Click on multiple nodes (3-4 nodes)
3. Each clicked node should get green selection box
4. Selection counter should update in GUI
```

#### Step 3.3: Box Selection with Shift+Drag
```bash
1. Hold Shift key
2. Click and drag to create selection box
3. Dashed green box should appear during drag
4. All nodes within box should be selected when released
```

#### Step 3.4: Selection Visual Feedback
- [ ] Green selection boxes appear around selected objects
- [ ] Selection boxes are semi-transparent (30% opacity)
- [ ] Multiple objects can be selected simultaneously
- [ ] Selection counter updates in real-time

#### Step 3.5: Keyboard Shortcuts
**Ctrl+A (Select All):**
- [ ] Press Ctrl+A
- [ ] All visible nodes should be selected
- [ ] Selection counter should show total count

**Escape (Clear Selection):**
- [ ] Press Escape key
- [ ] All selections should be cleared
- [ ] Selection counter should reset to 0

**Delete (Delete Selected):**
- [ ] Select some nodes
- [ ] Press Delete key
- [ ] Selected nodes should be removed from scene

**F1 (Help Overlay):**
- [ ] Press F1 key
- [ ] Help overlay should appear
- [ ] Should show keyboard shortcuts and instructions

### 🔄 **Phase 4: Batch Operations Testing** (3 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Access Batch Operations
```bash
1. Select multiple objects (use Ctrl+Click or Shift+Drag)
2. Open "Auswahl & Batch" folder in right GUI panel
3. Verify selection info shows correct counts
```

#### Step 4.2: Test Batch Color Change
```bash
1. In "🎨 Batch-Farbe" subfolder:
2. Change color picker to red
3. Click "Farbe anwenden"
4. All selected objects should turn red
```

#### Step 4.3: Test Batch Size Change
```bash
1. In "📐 Batch-Transformation" subfolder:
2. Change "Größe" slider to 2.0
3. Click "Größe anwenden"
4. All selected objects should become larger
```

#### Step 4.4: Test Batch Movement
```bash
1. In "🔄 Batch-Bewegung" subfolder:
2. Set X-Versatz to 2.0
3. Click "Bewegen"
4. All selected objects should move 2 units on X-axis
```

#### Step 4.5: Test Batch Alignment
```bash
1. In "📏 Batch-Ausrichtung" subfolder:
2. Set Achse to "y" and Modus to "center"
3. Click "Ausrichten"
4. All selected objects should align on Y-axis
```

### ⚡ **Phase 5: Performance Testing** (2 minutes)

#### Step 5.1: Load Large Dataset
```bash
1. Click "Mega Netzwerk" button
2. Wait for network to load (200 nodes, 700 edges)
3. Check loading time (should be < 5 seconds)
```

#### Step 5.2: Performance with Large Dataset
- [ ] Camera controls remain responsive
- [ ] Layout algorithms work smoothly
- [ ] Multi-select works with many objects
- [ ] No significant lag or freezing

#### Step 5.3: Memory Stability
```bash
1. Switch between different networks multiple times:
   - Kleines Netzwerk → Mega Netzwerk → Mittleres Netzwerk
2. Check browser memory usage (F12 → Performance tab)
3. Memory should remain stable (no continuous growth)
```

#### Step 5.4: FPS Monitoring
```bash
1. Open Performance folder in GUI
2. Click "Performance-Stats"
3. Check reported FPS (should be > 30)
4. Frame time should be < 33ms
```
